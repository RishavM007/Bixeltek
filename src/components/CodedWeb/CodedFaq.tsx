  {
    question: "What is a custom-coded website?",
    answer:
      "A custom-coded website is built from the ground up (e.g., React/Next.js + Node/Laravel) with code, routing, data models, and UX tailored to your goals. Unlike themes/builders, you control rendering strategy (SSR/SSG/ISR), integrations, performance budgets, and security.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should we choose custom code vs. a CMS theme?",
    answer:
      "Choose custom code when you need speed at scale, complex UX/logic, multi-region localization, strict security, or deep integrations. If content teams need a familiar editor, we pair custom front-ends with CMS back-ends (Hybrid/Headless) so marketers keep their workflows.",
  },
  {
    question: "What’s the difference between Hybrid and Headless?",
    answer:
      "Hybrid: CMS (WordPress/Shopify) remains the editor; a custom React/Next.js front-end consumes CMS data for instant-feel UX.\n\nHeadless: CMS and front-end are fully decoupled via APIs (GraphQL/REST) for maximum performance, multi-channel publishing, and engineering freedom.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will a custom build help SEO?",
    answer:
      "Yes—because we design semantic architecture: entity-driven URLs, internal linking, canonical/hreflang rules, and JSON-LD injected at build time. Faster rendering improves crawl efficiency, Core Web Vitals, and ad Quality Scores.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do Core Web Vitals affect conversions and ads?",
    answer:
      "Better LCP/INP/CLS → higher organic rank, stronger engagement, and lower CPC in paid campaigns. We enforce vitals in CI (builds fail if budgets regress) and benchmark with field data, not just lab tests.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we keep WordPress or Shopify and still go custom?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We routinely ship Hybrid (custom front-end + WordPress/Shopify back-end) or Headless (Next.js + APIs) so teams keep their editors while users get instant-loading UX.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about security and compliance?",
    answer:
      "We implement OWASP controls, CSP/HSTS, least-privilege IAM, secret management, dependency scans, and WAF/CDN protection. Consent, data retention, and logs are aligned to GDPR/CCPA. Payment flows follow PCI-aware patterns.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a custom build take?",
    answer:
      "Typical ranges:\nHybrid marketing site: 4–8 weeks\nHeadless corporate/e-com: 8–14 weeks\nComplex platforms/portals: 12–20+ weeks\nTimeline depends on scope, integrations, content readiness, and localization.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost?",
    answer:
      "We price by scope/complexity rather than pages. You’ll get a fixed proposal with milestones; ongoing care (SLA, CRO, SRE) is optional but recommended for growth.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you track conversions and revenue?",
    answer:
      "We deliver analytics governance: GA4 (server-side where applicable), GTM standards, Meta CAPI, event naming conventions, consent mode, and CRM pipelines (HubSpot/Odoo/Salesforce). Every form, call, and checkout is traceable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support multilingual/RTL builds?",
    answer:
      "Yes—Arabic, English, French and more. We maintain routing parity, mirrored content blocks, RTL layout rules, and region-specific schema so both users and crawlers get a consistent experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after launch?",
    answer:
      "We monitor vitals, errors, and conversions; run A/B tests; and maintain security patches. Most clients keep us on an optimization plan for continuous gains.",
